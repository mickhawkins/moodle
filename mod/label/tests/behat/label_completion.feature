    And I log in as "teacher1"

    And I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:

  Scenario: Use manual completion
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Label" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Label text          | Music history                                        |
      | Completion tracking | Students can manually mark the activity as completed |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    # Teacher view.
    And the manual completion button for "Music history" should be disabled
    And I log out
    # Student view.
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    Then the manual completion button of "Music history" is displayed as "Mark as done"
    And I toggle the manual completion state of "Music history"
    And the manual completion button of "Music history" is displayed as "Done"
